# driftCam


<p>Lua port of drift camera mod</p>
<p>This is a LUA mod that lets you set your camera angle a bit higher on vehicles in GTA San Andreas.</p>

### [Pre-requisites]
1. ASI Loader
2. Moonloader

### [Installation]
Put the __driftcam.lua__ file from this repository to your Moonloader folder.

### [Usage]

<p>Use <b>/driftcam</b> in-game to toggle the mod.</p>
<p>If you are trying to disable it, the mod won't take effect immediately. You'll have to spawn another vehicle to disable the mod. I don't plan on fixing this issue, but you can contribute a fix if you like.<p>

### [Credits]
<p>I found the opcodes from a cleo that does the same thing, but I don't remember what it was. If you are the author please let me know via an issue and I will credit you here or take the mod down if you wish.</p>
